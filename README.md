# Asterisk Attack

A superhero game and an exercise in Javascript.

The idea was to build a game _entirely_ in text, without any images, but font characters rotate wobbly due to line heights. So, the asterisks are SVGs. Oh, well. Games in JS should use the Canvas API or SVG anyway, rather than dom manipulations.

Play the game on [www.asteriskattack.com](http://www.asteriskattack.com).
