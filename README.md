# Asterisk Attack

An experiment with Javascript. The idea was to learn JavaScript a bit better by making a game.

After a little while the idea was extended so that the game would be _entirely_ in text; no images whatsoever, nor anything else. But font characters spin wobbly due to the spacing rendered around text; so the game's spinning asterisks are SVGs, not text. Oh, well!

Furthermore, building a game with DOM manipulations ain't too performant. Choose rather to build with SVG or Canvas, or a mix of the two.

Play the game on [www.asteriskattack.com](http://www.asteriskattack.com).
